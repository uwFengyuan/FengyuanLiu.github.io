My name is Fengyuan Liu.

I am currently a research intern at Tencent AI Lab & Robotics X. I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Rui Zhao](https://ruizhaogit.github.io/) and [Dr. Jindong Gu](https://jindonggu.github.io/). 

I received my B.S. degree in Computer Science and in Applied and Computational Mathematical Science (Data Science and Statistics track) from the University of Washington. I got an M.S. degree in Avanced Computer Science from the University of Oxford, and was fortunate to be mentored by the very best [Dr. Jindong Gu](https://jindonggu.github.io/) and [Prof. Philip Torr](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kPxa2w0AAAAJ&hl=en). In Summer 2022, I was an intern at the ADL Group at Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences, Tsinghua University, and fortunate to be mentored by [Prof. Jian Li](http://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jianli/).

My current research interests lie in Safety of Foundation Model and Multimodal AI. 

I am happy to answer any questions and chat about research/collaboration! Reach me at \oxfengyuan@gmail.com.
